# About

This is where I blog about my [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/) adventures.

This blog is very experimental.

In Rachel Thomas's [Advice for Better Blog Posts](https://www.fast.ai/2019/05/13/blogging-advice/), she makes it clear that we should aim for "high quality blogging", spending 3 or 4 full days on a post.

I'm taking a different tack so far, which is to try to do a bunch of short posts. Longer than tweets, but shorter than a detailed post that would take 3 or 4 days to write. The idea is to have a quantity of posts on small topics, rather than a few high-quality posts. Since I am learning a lot right now, I don't feel it's worth writing in as lot of detail a bunch of stuff that will be obsoleted anyway a week later.
