# Information about how this blog is written

This is some basic info about how to write posts in
[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29), 
the platform that this [fast.ai](fast.ai) blog runs on.

None of this has anything to do with AI. But it's an example
of some of the nice side-effects of studying the fast.ai course: 
you learn some neat tricks! 
Including [this method](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) 
for _anyone_ to have their own blog for free, 
without knowing anything technical, and without ads.

Here's the table of contents:

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit 
numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself 
what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for Markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, 
then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" 
in Markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but 
repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` 
above.

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is the simple markup 
language used to specify text formatting like, bold, italics, and more, 
as described briefly below. 

More detailed information can be found on 
[the official Markdown page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) 
on John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) website.

This blog post, like all the other posts on this blog, 
is of course itself written in Markdown. 
You can see this code by looking at 
[the code for this page](https://github.com/kaicarver/kaicarver.github.io/blame/master/_posts/2020-01-14-welcome.md)
in its repository on GitHub.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create 
[links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). 
Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:
