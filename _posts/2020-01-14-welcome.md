# Technical information about how this blog is written

This is some basic info about how to write posts in [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29), the platform that this [fast.ai](fast.ai) blog runs on.

Here's the table of contents:

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for Markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in Markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is the simple markup language used to specify text formatting like, bold, italics, and more, as described briefly below. More detailed information can be found on [the official Markdown page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) on John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) website.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:
