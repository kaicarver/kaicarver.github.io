# Different platforms

Different platforms work differently.

This is not about AI, but since it's a stumbling block, I'll discuss what I found.

These are the options I have explored for running fast.ai software:

* Gradient Paperspace
* Google Colab
* running on my own PC (just to try)

There are considerable differences.

Several topics:

* availability
  * how easy is it to just run it?
* ease of use
  * how complicated to use it, share things
* features
  * upload widget
* speed
  * how long to do basic AI test like the cat and dog example?
* cost
  * free instances are great, but not always available

My choice so far is Gradient Paperspace. It works, free instances are available sometimes, and anyway we get a 15-dollar credit as fast.ai students.

I "upgraded" by paying 8 dollars a month, because I was a bit confused and thought it might make things easier for me. But as far as I can tell this does nothing for me, since I currently don't need private instances. I'd be happy to hear from others on this.
