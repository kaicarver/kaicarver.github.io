# L

Sanyam suggested we could write a blog post about **L**.

So here goes.

The [documentation about **L**](https://fastcore.fast.ai/#L) references Larry Wall's dictum that "commonly used things should be shorter". That's why **L** is the very short class name of fastai's list object.

I'm not a Python expert, so I'll gladly admit I'm confused by the large number of list-like objects that we deal with in Python and its fast.ai dialect. 

As far as I can tell, there are lists, tuples, arrays, numpy arrays, tensors (PyTorch), and these fast.ai lists of class **L**.
