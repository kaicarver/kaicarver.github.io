# Repeatability crisis

This is silly. We're doing science! My experiments should be repeatable. But in my very first experiment, I have some problemsrepeating my experiment. Sometimes a cat picture is recognized as a cat, sometimes it isn't. Part of the problem is that the process is so manual. I upload a photo of a cat, go to another cell, run the experiment, look at it, ...

Obviously later on in the course we do this better, but I need better testing for my very first experiment.
