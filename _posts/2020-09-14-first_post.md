# Hello 世界

This is my first post, accept no imitations.

Yes, I now have a [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) *blog*!

Actually I have _two_. What you are currently looking at is the simple version I first set up, but I also now have a [_fastpages_ blog](http://kaicarver.github.io/fastai).

I'll choose one soon, right now I have two, but I am using the simple version...

世界 means "world" in Chinese. I was just checking that this blog software works with non-English characters. It does, hooray!

Here is more information about the two fast.ai blogging tools:
* [_fast_template_](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/), simple and easy to setup,
* [_fastpages_](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html), which also handles Jupyter notebooks.

Under the hood, both blogs are hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and use [Jekyll, the simple, blog-aware, static web site generator by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) (as he described in ["Blogging Like a Hacker"](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) back in 2008).
