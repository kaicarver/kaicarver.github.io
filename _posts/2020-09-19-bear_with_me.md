# Downloading bears

Well, I had an Azure API key, vut apparently my free account ran out, and I need to pay 25 dollars for a month.

So I'll try some less advanced methods for getting my pictures of bears. Jeremy did say there were methods that break the terms of service of various tools, so I will try to do this discreetly and without causing trouble.
