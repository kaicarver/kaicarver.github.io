# First real post?

This is supposed to be my first real post.

Working on it...

My idea is to 

- introduce myself very briefly
- talk briefly about setting up
- give a real example, which may just be discussion of cats and dogs and alligators

It's just to get my feet wet, and I need to do more studying, not spend too long on blogging.
